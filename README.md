## FAQ

#### How I managed the state in my assignment project?

In my assignment I used two state hooks. One is useState and the other one is useEffect. In Home component I used my first useState and useEffect hooks to fetch the fake data(json) from public folder. Secondly, I used this hooks in card 'SELECT' button. There, I used this hooks to access the card data(json) then this data sent in next component(Card). Lastly, I used two more hooks. This hooks were used for to sent calculated data in the Card component. To sending this data I used props method.
